# UpdateEvents-JSS
An app that updates new events For the airplane.

We are the three web developers: Sahar Saker @saharsaker, Sarah Saeed @sara141 and Jasmine Badrih @Jasmineb2011

This app informs the user when his his airplane is going to arrive, departure and the flight's number, all he should do is typing the aiplane's name in the box.

For this app to work, we used couple of files:

*In the public folder:*

1. index.html

2. style.css

3. dom.js

*In the src folder:*

1. handlers.js: used new methods such as: readFileSync, writeHead etc.

2. router.js: how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URLs) respond to client requests.

3. server.js: where we script the functions.

4. test.js: where we test our functions.
